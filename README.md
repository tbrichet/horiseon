OVERVIEW
Weekly Challenge 1:
HTML CSS Git Challenge | Code Refractor | Horiseon Webpage
Student Name | Tara Brichetto
Challenge Due Date: 02 August 2020

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This challenge consisted of an "on-the-job ticket" in which I was given starter code and mock-up for a webpage. My task was to improve accessibility standards and ensure the site was optimized for search engines. In order to accomplish this, I was asked to add/improve semantic HTML elements, eusre the elements followed a logial structure, add alt attributes to image elements, ensure headings fell in sequential order, and improve the title element. In doing so, I also needed to "clean up" and add comments to the code.
