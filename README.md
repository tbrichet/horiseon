## Purpose
This challenge consisted of an "on-the-job ticket" in which I was given starter code and mock-up for a webpage. My task was to improve accessibility standards and ensure the site was optimized for search engines.

## Project Requirements
* Given a webpage meets accessibility standards <br>
* When I view the source code <br>
* Then I find semantic HTML elements <br>
* When I view the structure of the HTML elements <br>
* Then I find the elements to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning <br>
* When I view the image elements <br>
* Then I find accessible alt attributes <br>
* When I view the heading attributes <br>
* Then they fall in sequential order <br>
* When I view the title element <br>
* Then I find a concise, descriptive title <br>

## Languages
* HTML <br>
* CSS <br>
